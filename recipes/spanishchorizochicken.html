        Spanish chorizo stuffed chicken breast is a prime example of my successful attempts in making boneless skinless chicken breast less boringâ€”one foolproof thing is stuffing it with sausage.<p/>
        <ol>
            <li> Mix olive oil, garlic, and oregano in a small bowl and set aside. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Use a sharp thin knife to make five deep slashes at a 45-degree angle into the chicken breast, about an inch apart, going almost, but not quite all the way through.  Leave about 1/2-inch of breast un-cut on either side of the slash.</li>
            <li>Salt chicken breasts generously on both sides, and spoon oil mixture on top. Rub olive oil mixture into slashes, and all over the surface and bottom of the breasts.</li>
            <li>Slide slices of chorizo into the slashes in the chicken. Once inserted, at least 75% of the sausage slice should be covered by chicken.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to an oven safe skillet or pan, and pour over any extra oil. Dust breasts with breadcrumbs, and sprinkle with cheese.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from pan, and let rest on plate, loosely covered with foil.</li>
            <li>Add vinegar and sherry to the pan and turn the heat to medium high. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cook until sauce has reduced by half.</li>
            <li>Add any accumulated juices from the plate of chicken to the pan. Reduce heat to lowest setting and stir in cold butter. Stir constantly until butter has disappeared.</li>
            <li>Turn off heat, and stir in the parsley. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to plates and top with sauce.</li>
        </ol>
